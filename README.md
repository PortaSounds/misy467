# Overview
### MISY467 Machine Learning for Business, Spring 2020

This course introduces the basic concepts and techniques of machine learning and covers most commonly used models for predictive analytics. The end-to-end workflow for typical machine learning projects is illustrated via multiple business programming cases. If time permits, deep learning techniques are also introduced. This course is programming intensive using Python 3 and popular packages/frameworks, such as Jupyter, Numbpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.

Key Topics:

- AI and Machine Learning Overview
- Toolset Bootcamp (Git, Python 3, Jupyter, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seanborn, Scikit-Learn)
- End-to-end Machine Learning Workflow
- Feature Engineering
- Classification (Decision Tree, Linear/Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Clustering (K-means)
- Ensemble Learning
- Deep Learning Introduction (optional)
